Website for landing and presentation of an interior design company.
Fully responsive.
There is a gallery of projects with the ability to filter by category. The feedback form allows the owner to receive messages from users by email, made using a third-party service. Built-in google maps.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Handlebars

Implementation of [spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral) - [html5up](https://html5up.net) template.
Built using Node.js, Express framework and Handlebars templating language.

## Optimizations
- Opt out of a third-party email service.
- Add buttons for scrolling through enlarged images in the gallery.
- Should use db for storing design projects (images and text content) => make a single page for each project.
- Users should leave reviews.

## Lessons Learned:

Found several free services for sending email notifications with form data filled by the user. Should be great for building an MVP quickly, although not for production.
