## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Handlebars

[Spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral) - [html5up](https://html5up.net) template implementation.
Built with Express web framework and Handlebars view engine.

## Optimizations
- Opt out of a third-party email service.
- Add ability to scroll through enlarged images in the gallery.
- Should use db for storing design projects (images and text content)
- Make a single page for each project.
- Add opportunity for customers to leave feedback.

## Lessons Learned:

Found several free services for sending email notifications with form data filled by the user. Suitable for building an MVP quickly, although not for production.
